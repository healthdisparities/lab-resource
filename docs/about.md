# About
Genomics Research for Health Equity is headed by Dr. Leonardo Mariño-Ramírez at the Division of Intramural Research (DIR), [National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/), [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/).


## Our research focus
We use integrative approaches to solve complex and challenging biological problems that are focused on reducing health disparities in underrepresented populations of the United States. Our research focuses on studying both the genetic and environmental contributions to health disparities through a combined analysis of genetic ancestry and electronic health records in large biobank cohorts to discover and map disease genes and their variants.
